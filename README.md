# EdaGarmonia

Simple Delivery Club frontend-only copy.

Nuxt 2 + store (Vuex) used, plus a couple of packages like `vue-carousel`.

Written in 2020, when I was trying out Tailwind CSS.

## Build Setup

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
